# GergiH dotfiles

Totally random dotfiles, mostly default configs, recently Neovim is the only one used from these, rarely updated.

## Neovim

1. Copy the contents of `nvim` into `~/.config/nvim/` on Linux, or `~/AppData/Local/nvim/` on Windows
2. Install Node.js
3. Install C Compiler with `sudo apt install build-essential` or through MinGW on Windows
4. Run `:checkhealth nvim-treesitter` and install dependencies if needed
5. Run `:checkhealth telescope` and install the dependencies if needed
6. Run `:TSInstall <langname>` for treesitter (language names can be found in its docs)
